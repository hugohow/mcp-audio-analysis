Copy-past the path

On MacOS: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json On Windows: %APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

```
"mcpServers": { "Music Analysis with librosa": { "command": "uv", "args": [ "--directory", "PATH", "run", "src/mcp_music_analysis/server.py" ] } }
```

It's now available on Claude Desktop.

## Example Prompts

Here are some sample prompts you might use in a conversational or chat-based context once the server is running. The MCP will understand these requests and execute the relevant tools:

```
Can you analyze the beat of /Users/hugohow-choong/Desktop/sample-6s.mp3?
Could you give me the duration of https://download.samplelib.com/mp3/sample-15s.mp3 ?
Please compute the MFCC for this file: /path/to/another_audio.mp3
What are the spectral centroid values for /path/to/music.wav?
I'd like to know the onset times for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HFiFd9vx1c
```
